# Sidecar               -> define between which sidecards the traffic can flow 
# ServiceEntry / egress -> how to flow traffic outside the mesh
# PeerAuthorizastion    -> TLS encription between traffic from sidcars to non istion apps (Peer Enciprion)
#     # mode STRICT     -> must be encripted
#     # allowes only one mesh wide policy ( takes the oldest)
#     # allowes only one namespace wide policy ( take the oldest)
#     # preseeedence top to bottom
#     # workload specific -> namespace wide -> mesh wide
#     # best practice is => avoid multiple mesh wide / namespace wide policies per mesh, per namespace
# RequestAuthntication  -> extracts the auth pricipels from incoming token.s (Does not block anything)
# AuthorizationPolicy   -> apply ALLOW / DENY policies based on the auth details
#         -> evaluate precedence order --> CUSTOM DENY > DENY > ALLOW
